**Some use-cases**
Moving from onprem to cloud; you can write a script to copy your syslog of routers and firewall to s3 bucket using aws cli cp function
We can also get cloud trails log that has been monitoring different API endpoint, choose S3 as the storage destination and ingest into sumo logic


AWS services, lastpass, github, OKTA, Kubernetes. These are what can be ingested into cloudtrail
Sometimes, we could try routers
