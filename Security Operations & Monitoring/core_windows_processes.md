We need to understand the normal behaviour of windows OS (create a baseline) so we can identify malicious processes running on endpoints. Anti-virus is the first solution for defensive approach. Then we have EDRs because anti virus cannot catch every malicious software
if one of the defense tools alerts us about a malicious process, we must investigate and decide a course of action. We must know the normal behaviour of the system that we are defending and we must infer if the binary is benign or evil.
