Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  is software that aggregates and analyzes information from several different sources across the entire infrastructure. So, instead of going through every security appliance's console, you get one centralized solution to find the alerts and react accordingly. This solution not only centralizes the information but also performs a deep analysis of the information to find hidden patterns and see if your company is under attack.
Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) will help you with threat and vulnerability management, security incident response, and security operations automation by bringing order to the alerts your SIEM creates. It will give you more insight into what steps come next and what actions need immediate attention.
First, we need to know what assets we are trying to monitor:
Firewall
Antivirus
Routers and switches
Intrusion prevention systems
Databases
Servers
Workstations

Preparation: creating the strategy to tackle all the different incidents and attacks your organization may face. Some common activities performed at this stage are:
Creating incident response policies and procedures
Establishing communication paths
Creating a continuous improvement plan and testing it frequently
Identification: This is where SIEM, SOAR, and PlayBooks come in handy. In this step, you need to assess the alert and see if it's a false positive or if it is, in fact, malicious activity.
Containment; At this stage, you try to minimize the threat and the impact. This can be done by containing the threat (e.g., disconnecting the affected machines from the network) or by applying specific countermeasures.
Eradication
This is where you try to eliminate the threat once and for all. For example, if you have an infected host you may need to format the affected systems or bring the system to a non-affected state (e.g., a previous snapshot of a virtual machine).
Recovery
This stage is critical for business continuity because it is the step where you bring everything to the original operational state. The longer it takes to fully recover from an incident, the more costly it can become.
Lessons Learned
This is where you document the incident and the whole recovery process from beginning to end. This gives the team the opportunity to evaluate processes, strategies, and other plans to deal with potential future events more effectively.
root cause analysis (RCA). An RCA is the process that will lead you to the first or main factor that caused a problem and should thus be permanently eliminated to avoid future occurrences. In other words, RCA is the process that helps to determine the core issue that will trigger the entire cause-and-effect reaction that ultimately leads to the problem(s) or incidents.
A disaster recovery plan (DRP) is a process that describes how an organization can quickly resume work after an incident. A DRP is an essential part of a business continuity plan (BCP).
While a DRP is purely focused on technology, the BCP is focused on the business. As an example, consider that the company lost the ability to sell online since their webserver is down. The BCP policy can dictate that the business is to continue selling over the phone, a messaging app, email, etc. The DRP, on the other hand, will try to restore the webserver's availability to continue selling online. In other words, the BCP is focused on the business and the DRP on the technology.
